# Game of Life
Playing around with the Game of Life in Java.

## Rules
The rules of the game are simple:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


## Drivers
- ConsoleDriver: A simple console driver that prints the game board to the console.
- GameOfLifeUI: A simple UI driver that uses JavaFX to display the game board.
